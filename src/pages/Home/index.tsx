                Itâ€™s been three years since New York has passed significant
                legislation addressing the climate crisis. In that time, the
                climate emergency has accelerated, with increased extreme heat,
                fires, storms, and floods.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>We demand</b> that the New York State Legislature and
                Governor Hochul <b>fulfill the promises</b> of the Climate
                Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA), listen to the
                vast majority of New Yorkers who{" "}
                <b>support bold climate policies</b>, and
                <b> take action</b> in 2022 by passing twelve urgently needed
                climate bills.
              </p>
              <p>
                We can no longer wait. That's why young climate activists are
                riding their bikes from NYC to Albany and hosting rallies along
                the way until our mobilization in Albany.
